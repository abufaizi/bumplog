I will not delete notes manually, I will have to create a method to delete notes.
Bumplog should work symbiotically with the human brain and it's natural methods of storing and retrieving experiences and thoughts
This is an example note
Natural selection for your recorded thoughts
Place a bar beside the 'highlighted' log
kkklkkkkjlkj;lkj;lkj;l j;lkj lkjl; j;lkj ;lkj ;lj ;lkj lkj ;lkj l;kj l;j;lkj

Take into consideration the last time a log was seen as well as the last time a log was bumped. Determine the strength based on these variables.
This is an example text
new_log
